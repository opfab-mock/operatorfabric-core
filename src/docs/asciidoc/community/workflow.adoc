= Contribution Workflow

//TODO Make sure everything that is stated is enforced (or log it in an issue)
//TODO Check base branch for PRs
//TODO Limit which branches can be merged into develop or master
//TODO Manage who can merge/push into master, merge into develop, create release branches?

The project started out using a
link:https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow[Feature Branch workflow], but
as the project team grew and we needed to manage support to previous releases we decided to switch to a workflow
based on the
link:{git_flow_post}[Git Flow workflow], starting after version 1.3.0.RELEASE.

The principles for this workflow were first described in the blog post linked above, and this document attempts to
summarize how we adapted it to our project. Statements in quotes are from the original blog post.

//TODO Ask if we can use images from blog, otherwise make our own

NOTE: In this document, *"repository version"* refers to the version defined in the VERSION file at the root of the
project, which is a parameter for certain build tasks and for our CICD pipeline.

== Principles

//TODO Create diagram with all branches

=== Main branches

==== `develop` branch

image::main_branches.png[Main branches, 300, float="right",align="center"]

The role of the `develop` branch is quite similar to that of the `master` branch in our previous "Feature Branch"
workflow.

The `develop` branch is where feature branches are branched off from, and where they're merged back to. This way,
the HEAD of the `develop` branch _"always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next
release"_.

The repository version on the `develop` branch should always be `SNAPSHOT`.

The daily CRON Travis job generating the documentation and docker images for the `SNAPSHOT` version are run from
this branch (see our
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<CICD, CICD documentation>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/CICD/index.adoc, CICD documentation>>]
for details).

==== `master` branch

_"When the source code in the develop branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all of the changes
should be merged back into master somehow and then tagged with a release number."_

This means that any commit on master is a production-ready release, be it a patch, a minor or a major version.

Any commit on `master` triggers a Travis build generating and pushing documentation and docker images for the
corresponding release version. If the `ci_latest` keyword is used in the commit message, the docker images are also
tagged with `latest`.

=== Supporting branches

==== Feature branches

Feature branches are used to develop new features or fix bugs *for the next release*. The version number for this next
release is usually not known during the developments as it is its final contents that will determine whether it's a
major or minor version (or even a simple patch).
By contrast, hotfix branches fix bugs in existing releases and give rise to new patches.

The lifecycle of feature branches is as follows:
. A new feature branch is branched off `develop` before starting work on a feature or bug.
. Once the developments are deemed ready by the developer(s) working on the feature, a pull request should be created
for this branch.
. New pull requests are discussed during daily meetings to assign someone from the Reviewers group to the issue.
. The pull request author and reviewer(s) then make use of the
link:https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests[Git Hub pull requests]
features (comments, proposed changes, etc.) to make changes to the PR until it meets the project requirements.
. Once it is ready to be included in the next version, the pull request is then merged back into `develop`.

*Naming convention:* Feature branches names should always start with the reference of the JIRA issue they're addressing,
optionally followed by additional information if several branches are associated with a given JIRA issue.

.Examples of valid feature branch names:
* OC-123
* OC-123_Documentation
* OC-123_1

.Examples of invalid feature branch names:
* 123
* OC123
* SomeTextDescribingTheBranch

//TODO Link to section describing JIRA workflow once it's written
//TODO When should we delete supporting branches?

==== Release branches

Once developments are in a release-ready state and have been tested on the `develop` branch, a release branch should
be created off `develop` to prepare the merge into master.

NOTE: _"All features that are targeted for the release-to-be-built must be merged in to develop at this point in time.
All features targeted at future releases may notâ€”they must wait until after the release branch is branched off."_

IMPORTANT: By contrast to what is described in the link:{git_flow_post}[original blog post], for now we have chosen to
only create the release branch once the developments are completely ready and tested on the develop branch, so that no
fixes should be made on the release branch. This simplifies things because it means that release branches don't have to
be merged back into `develop`.

Once the `X.X.X.release` branch has been created, a new commit should be made on this branch to change the repository
version from `SNAPSHOT` to `X.X.X.RELEASE`.
Then, pushing the branch will trigger a build and a "dry-run" generation of documentation and docker images. The aim
is to detect any issue with this generation before moving to master.

Finally, the `X.X.X.release` can be merged into `master`, triggering
The resulting merge commit on `master` should then be tagged with `X.X.X.RELEASE`.

All commits on `master` should be merge commits from `release` branches, direct pushes on master will be disabled.

*Naming convention:* The name of a release branch should match the repository version it is meant to merge into
`master` but in lower case to avoid confusion with release tags on master.

Example: The valid branch name for the branch bringing 1.3.0.RELEASE into `master` is 1.3.0.release

==== Hotfix

//TODO
Work in progress: detail hotfix branches lifecycle and constraints.

*Naming convention:* Hotfix branches names should always start with "HF_" and the reference of the JIRA issue they're
addressing, optionally followed by additional information if several branches are associated with a given JIRA issue.

.Examples of valid hotfix branch names:
* HF_OC-123
* HF_OC-123_Documentation
* HF_OC-123_1

.Examples of invalid hotfix branch names:
* 123
* OC-123
* OC123
* HF_SomeTextDescribingTheFix
* SomeTextDescribingTheFix

== Examples and commands

=== Initial state

In the initial state of our example, only `develop` and `master` exist.

The repository version in `master` is `1.3.0.RELEASE`, and the `develop` branch has just been branched off it. A single
commit has been added to `develop` to change the repository version to `SNAPSHOT`.
