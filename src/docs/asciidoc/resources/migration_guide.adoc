= Migration Guide from release 1.4.0 to release 1.5.0 

== Refactoring of configuration management 

=== Motivation for the change

The initial situation was to have a `Third` concept that was meant to represent third-party applications that publish
content (cards) to OperatorFabric.
As such, a Businessconfig was both the sender of the message and the unit of configuration for resources for card rendering.

[NOTE]
Because of that mix of concerns, naming was not consistent across the different services in the backend and frontend as
this object could be referred to using the following terms:
* Third
* ThirdParty
* Bundle
* Publisher

But now that we're aiming for cards to be sent by entities, users (see Free Message feature) or external services, it
doesn't make sense to tie the rendering of the card ("Which configuration bundle should I take the templates and
details from?") to its publisher ("Who/What emitted this card and who/where should I reply?").


=== Changes to the model

To do this, we decided that the `publisher` of a card would now have the sole meaning of `emitter`, and that the link
to the configuration bundle to use to render a card would now be based on its `process` field.

==== On the Businessconfig model

We used to have a `Businessconfig` object which had an array of `Process` objects as one of its properties.
Now, the `Process` object replaces the `Businessconfig` object and this new object combines the properties of the old `Businessconfig`
and `Process` objects (menuEntries, states, etc.).

[IMPORTANT]
In particular, this means that while in the past one bundle could "contain" several processes, now there can be only
one process by bundle.

The `Businessconfig` object used to have a `name` property that was actually its unique identifier (used to retrieve it through
the API for example).
It also had a `i18nLabelKey` property that was meant to be the i18n key to determine the display name of the
corresponding businessconfig, but so far it was only used to determine the display name of the associated menu in the navbar in
case there where several menu entries associated with this businessconfig.

Below is a summary of the changes to the `config.json` file that all this entails:

|===
|Field before |Field after |Usage

|name
|id
|Unique identifier of the bundle. Used to match the `publisher` field in associated cards, should now match `process`

|
|name
|I18n key for process display name. 

|
|states.mystate.name
|I18n key for state display name. 

|i18nLabelKey
|menuLabel
|I18n key for menu display name in case there are several menu entries attached to the process

|processes array is a root property, states array being a property of a given process
|states array is a root property
|
|===


Here is an example of a simple config.json file:

.Before
[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "TEST",
  "version": "1",
  "defaultLocale": "fr",
  "menuEntries": [
    {"id": "uid test 0","url": "https://opfab.github.io/","label": "menu.first"},
    {"id": "uid test 1","url": "https://www.la-rache.com","label": "menu.second"}
  ],
  "i18nLabelKey": "businessconfig.label",
  "processes": {
    "process": {
      "states": {
        "firstState": {
          "details": [
            {
              "title": {
                "key": "template.title"
              },
              "templateName": "operation"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

.After
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "TEST",
  "version": "1",
  "name": "process.label",
  "defaultLocale": "fr",
  "menuLabel": "menu.label",
  "menuEntries": [
    {"id": "uid test 0","url": "https://opfab.github.io/","label": "menu.first"},
    {"id": "uid test 1","url": "https://www.la-rache.com","label": "menu.second"}
  ],
  "states": {
    "firstState": {
      "name" :"mystate.label",
      "details": [
        {
          "title": {
            "key": "template.title"
          },
          "templateName": "operation"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
You should also make sure that the new i18n label keys that you introduce match what is defined in the i18n
folder of the bundle.

==== On the Cards model

|===
|Field before |Field after |Usage

|publisherVersion
|processVersion
|Identifies the version of the bundle. It was renamed for consistency now that bundles are linked to processes not
publishers

|process
|process
|This field is now required and should match the id field of the process (bundle) to use to render the card.


|processId
|processInstanceId
|This field is just renamed , it represent an id of an instance of the process
|===

These changes impact both current cards from the feed and archived cards.

[IMPORTANT]
The id of the card is now build as process.processInstanceId an not anymore publisherID_process.

== Change on the web-ui.json 

The parameter navbar.thirdmenus.type has been removed from this file. Starting from this release the related functionality has been moved on bundle basis and it's not more global. See "Changes on bundle config.json" for more information.

== Changes on bundle config.json

Under menuEntries a new subproperty has been added: linkType. This property replace the old property navbar.thirdmenus.type in web-ui.json, making possible a more fine control of the related behaviour.

== Component name 

We also change the component name of third which is now named businessconfig.

== Changes to the endpoints

The `/third` endpoint becomes `/businessconfig/processes`.

== Migration steps

This section outlines the necessary steps to migrate existing data.

[IMPORTANT]
You need to perform these steps before starting up the OperatorFabric instance because starting up services with the new
version while there are still "old" bundles in the businessconfig storage will cause the businessconfig service to crash.

. Backup your existing bundles and existing Mongo data.

. Edit your bundles as detailed above. In particular, if you had bundles containing several processes, you will need to
split them into several bundles. The `id` of the bundles should match the `process` field in the corresponding cards.

. If you use navbar.thirdmenus.type in web-ui.json, rename it to navbar.businessmenus.type

. Run the following scripts in the mongo shell to copy the value of `publisherVersion` to a new `processVersion` field and to copy the value of `processId` to a new `processInstanceId` field for all cards (current and archived):




//TODO Detail steps to mongo shell ?
+
.Current cards
[source, shell]
----
db.cards.updateMany(
{},
{ $rename: { "publisherVersion": "processVersion", "processId": "processInstanceId" } }
)
----
+
.Archived cards
[source, shell]
----
db.archivedCards.updateMany(
{},
{ $rename: { "publisherVersion": "processVersion", "processId": "processInstanceId" } }
)
----

. Make sure you have no cards without process using the following mongo shell commands:
+
[source, shell]
----
db.cards.find({ process: null})
----
+
[source, shell]
----
db.archivedCards.find({ process: null})
----

. If it turns out to be the case, you will need to set a process value for all these cards to finish the migration. You
can do it either manually through Compass or using a mongo shell command. For example, to set the process to "SOME_PROCESS"
for all cards with an empty process, use:
+
[source, shell]
----
db.cards.updateMany(
{ process: null },
{
$set: { "process": "SOME_PROCESS"}
}
)
----
+
[source, shell]
----
db.archivedCards.updateMany(
{ process: null },
{
$set: { "process": "SOME_PROCESS"}
}
)
----

. If you have any code or scripts that push bundles, you should update it to point to the new endpoint.
