= Sending cards

The Cards Publication Service exposes a REST API through which third-party applications, or "publishers" can post cards
to OperatorFabric. It then handles those cards:

* Time-stamping them with a "publishDate"
* Sending them to the message broker (RabbitMQ) to be delivered in real time to the appropriate operators
* Persisting them to the database (MongoDB) for later consultation
