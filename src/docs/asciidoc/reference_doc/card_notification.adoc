= Card notification

When a user receives a card, he is notified via a resume of the card on the left panel of the UI, what is called the "feed".

== Sound notification 

If the option is activated in the general configuration file web-ui.json, the user can choose to have a sound when a card is arriving. The configuration is to be set by the user with the settings menu.

== Card read 

When the user receives a new card, he see it in the feed with an eye icon on the right of the card resume. When he opens the cards, the icon disappears. 

== Card acknowledgment 

The user can set a card as "acknowledged" so he will not see it anymore by default in the feed. It is as well possible to cancel it and set a card to "unacknowledged" (a filter permit to see acknowledged cards). 

To offer the possibility for the user to acknowledged card, it has to be configured in process definition. The configuration is set on a state based with the acknowledgementAllowed field set to true  (default is false). You can see examples in src/test/utils/karate/businessconfig/resources/bundle_defaultProcess/config.json
[[card_reminder]]
== Card reminder 

For certain process and state, it is possible to configure a reminder. The reminder "reactivate" the card in the feed at a certain time. "Reactivate" means setting the card to the status "unread" and "unacknowledged".


The time for "reactivation" is defined with the parameter "secondsBeforeTimeSpanForReminder" in the card.

The remind is done related to the timespans values :

- the startDate 

- or recurrently if a recurrence objet is defined.

=== Simple reminder

If a timespan is present without a recurrence object, a reminder will arise at `startDate - secondsBeforeTimeSpanForReminder`.

=== Recurrent reminder

It is possible to set a recurrent reminder via the structure recurrence which define a regular event in the timespan structure. It is defined with the following fields : 

 - HoursAndMinutes : hours and minutes of day when the event arise

 - DayOfWeeks : a list of day of the week when the event arise. The day of week is a number with 1 being Monday and 7 being Sunday as defined in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates[the ISO Standard 8601 (weekday number) ]

 - TimeZone : the time zone of reference for the recurrence definition (default value is Europe/Paris)

The reminder will arise for each `recurrent date of event - secondsBeforeTimeSpanForReminder` starting from startDate. 

==== Recurrent reminder example 

If timespan is defined as follow : 

.... 
startDate : 1231135161
recurrence : {
    HoursAndMinutes : { hours:10 ,minutes:30},
    DaysOfWeeks : [6,7]
}
....

If secondsBeforeTimeSpanForReminder is set to 600 seconds, the reminder will arise every saturday and sunday at 10:20 starting from startDate 

=== Last time for reminding

If the user is not connected at the time of the remind,  when he connects if current time is superior to 15 minutes from the event date, no  remind will arise. 

=== Debugging 

When the user receives a card with a reminder to set, the log (console) of the browser contains a line with the date when the remind will arise . For example : 

`2020-11-22T21:00:36.011Z Reminder Will remind card userCardExamples.0cf5537b-f0df-4314-f17f-2797ccd8e4e9 at
