[[users_management]]
= User management 

The User service manages users, groups, entities and perimeters (linked to groups).

Users:: represent account information for a person destined to receive cards in the OperatorFabric instance.
Groups::
- represent set of users destined to receive collectively some cards.
- has a set of perimeters to define rights for card reception in OperatorFabric.
Entities::
- represent set of users destined to receive collectively some cards.
- can be used in a way to handle rights on card reception in OperatorFabric.

WARNING: The user define here is an internal representation of the individual card recipient in `OperatorFabric` the authentication is leave to specific OAuth2 external service.

NOTE: In the following commands the `$token` is an authentication token currently valid for the `OAuth2` service used by the current `OperatorFabric` system.


== Users, groups, entities and perimeters

User service manages users, groups, entities and perimeters.

=== Users

Users are the individuals and mainly physical person who can log in OperatorFabric.

The access to this service has to be authorized, in the `OAuth2` service used by the current `OperatorFabric` instance, at least to access User information and to manage Users. The membership of groups and entities are stored in the user information.

==== Automated user creation

In case of a user does exist in a provided authentication service but he does not exist in the `OperatorFabric`
instance, when he is authenticated and connected for the first time in the `OperatorFabric` instance, the user is
automatically created in the system without attached group or entity.
The administration of the groups, entities and perimeters is dealt by the administrator manually.

.

=== Groups
The notion of group is loose and can be used to simulate role in `OperatorFabric`.
Groups are used to send cards to several users without a name specifically. The information about membership to a
group is stored in the user information. A group contains a list of perimeters which define the rights of reception/writing for a couple process/state. The rules used to send cards are described in the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<card_recipients, recipients section>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#card_recipients, recipients section>>]
.

=== Entities
Entities are used to send cards to several users without a name specifically. The information about membership to an
entity is stored in the user information. Examples using entities can be found 
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<_send_to_several_users, here>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#_send_to_several_users, here>>]
.

=== Perimeters
Perimeters are used to define rights for reading/writing cards. A perimeter is composed of an identifier (unique), a process name and a list of state/rights couple.
Possible rights for receiving/writing cards are :

- Receive : the rights for receiving a card
- Write : the rights for writing a card, that is to say respond to a card or create a new card
- ReceiveAndWrite : the rights for receiving and writing a card

=== Alternative way to manage groups and entities

The standard way to handle groups and entities in `OperatorFabric` instance is dealt on the user information.
There is an alternative way to manage groups and entities through the authentication token, the groups and entities are defined by the administrator of the authentication service.
