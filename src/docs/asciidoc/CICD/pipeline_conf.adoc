= Pipeline Configuration

This section briefly describes the organization of our CICD pipeline. If you are looking for more detailed information,
see
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<mock_pipeline, this document>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/resources/index.adoc#mock_pipeline, this document>>]
describing the steps that were necessary to create our mock pipeline as well as the issues we ran into.

Most of the access and permissions required by our CICD plateform (Travis) are managed by tokens that are created on
each of the required services (SonarCloud, DockerHub, GitHub).
A technical user account (opfabtech) has been created for each of these services so that these tokens are not linked
to the account of any member of the team.

== CICD Pipeline


=== Travis CI

WORK in progress

//TODO Adapt documentation to Git Flow : Replace with proper table and add explanations
image::tmp_CICD_stages.png[]

//We use Travis CI to manage our pipeline. As of today, it is composed of 3 stages:
//[horizontal]
//test-assemble:: Run on every push regardless of the branch, does the build and produces test reports.
//It also triggers a sonar-scanner analysis and pushes the results to SonarCloud (except for external pull requests).
//doc:: Run only on the master branch, for the daily cron jobs or if a commit is push with a message containing
//ci_documentation. It generates the documentation (adoc, javadoc, compodoc, reports) and pushes it to the opfab.github.io
//repository to update the website.
//docker:: Run only on the master branch, for the daily cron jobs or if a commit is push with a message containing
//ci_docker. It generates the docker images for the current version and pushes them to DockerHub.

=== SonarCloud

To be allowed to push results to SonarCloud, Travis needs to be authenticated. This is done by generating a token on
SonarCloud with an account (opfabtech) that has admin rights to the organization, and then providing this token to Travis
either through the .travis.yml file or as an environment variable through Travis settings.

=== GitHub (documentation)

To be allowed to push the generated documentation to the opfab.github.io, Travis needs write access to the repository.
This is done by setting up a Personal Access Token in GitHub using the technical account.
This token is then passed to Travis as an environment variable through Travis settings, and is used in the .travis.yml file.
Right now the scope of this token is maximal, it can probably be reduced (see https://opfab.atlassian.net/browse/OC-755[OC-755]).

NOTE: After new content is pushed to the opfab.github.io repository, it can take a few minutes before this content is
visible on the website because it needs to be built by GitHub pages, and this can take a short while
depending on how busy the service is.

=== DockerHub
To be allowed to push images to DockerHub, Travis needs to be authenticated. This is done by setting the dockerhub
login and password of the technical account as environment variables through Travis settings and referencing them in
the .travis.yml file.
